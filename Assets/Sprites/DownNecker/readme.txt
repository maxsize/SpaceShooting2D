    I did not add the 512x512 images just the 2048x2048 and simple Normal map and Spec.map. That you may resize and sharpn if needed.
 ( I work with iso images so more detail is what I use ) Im not shure why but the image of the lower Airforce emb. looks ok in sculptris
 but not in blender?  no link or thanks are needed. 

                  But would like to see what you come up with even if its a animation gif.
